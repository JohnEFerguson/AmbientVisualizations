This repository contains code for three ambient visualizations used for research conducted by Jeannie Albrecht, Lylia Li and myself.  Each visualization uses different visual cues to express power and energy usage information.

The three visualizations are..

    Circles - Floating circles where each circle is a different appliance.  Power is indicated by opacity, energy is indicated by size.
    Pinwheels - Stationary pinwheels where each pinwheel is a different appliance.  Power is indicated by the speed of rotaion, energy is indicated by size.
    Hexagons - Stationary hexagons where each color is a different device.  Power is indicated by the number of hexagons, energy is indicated by their size.
