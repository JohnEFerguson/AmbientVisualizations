- get data stream --- got it somewhat
- get circles to show up randomly but not overlapping
- change initial vector so that it's more random
- call render function less frequently
  - ask morgan about it!!
  - use translate function for better performance
- deal with all the stuff we want the circles to do
- change colors to red gradient
- change ignores to instance variable
  - change so that pays attention to ignores when drawing circles


- color for each appliance
- circle grows slowly
- opacity varies with power
- find timer that is actually accurate 
- starting vectors more random
- make off circles tend towards bottom
- on click start again

- on_click 
  - reset energy to 0
  - change positions 
  - helps if the circles start to overlap
  - powered off and still colliding?
