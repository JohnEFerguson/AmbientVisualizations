If the screen turns green for some strange reason and outputs strange colors:
    - Test the HDMI cable and screen with another computer
    - Go into /boot/config.txt and enable 
       config_hdmi_boost=3
    - For some reason 3 works and higher numbers do not... don't ask me why.

Getting a Wemo to setup:
    - Holding the small white button under the power button, plug in the wall. (Hold for 30 seconds)
    - Wait until you see the Wemo wifi network start up on your phone.
    - Connect to this wifi network
    - Start up the Wemo app from Belkin on a phone. 
    - Follow setup instructions, connecting to the required wifi network.
    - Wait until the firmware is installed.
    - If you are using the private network, the wifi network is called Pi_Wifi.
        - See emacs /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf for password
        - See emacs /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf for assigned private ip
