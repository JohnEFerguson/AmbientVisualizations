Introduction/Instructions:
In this study, you will be shown an image that contains two hexagons.
For each image, please analyze the image displayed and judge which hexagon is
utilizing the most energy in this image. Please only consider the color of each
hexagon in the image, and not the size of the actual image, or the size of the
individual hexagons in the image. Please try your best to judge each hexagon
independently of the other hexagons. Please do this experiment in one sitting,
without taking any breaks.
